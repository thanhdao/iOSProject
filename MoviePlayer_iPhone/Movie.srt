Yep. We found him.

When was the last time
you spoke to this kid?

48

It's been a while.

49
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:58,357
Maybe a few years, even.

50
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:03,528
Last time I saw him, it was pretty ugly.

51
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,332
Well, there's a few different
versions in there,

52
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:13,105
but my people are pretty sure he's
being held at a Moscow prison

53
00:06:13,107 --> 00:06:15,607
awaiting sentencing.

54
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,576
What's he charged with?

55
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:19,311
It's a nasty sheet.

56
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,516
He'll be lucky to get life.

57
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,856
He can never get out of his own way.

58
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,626
He had a lot of problems.

59
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,030
He's still my kid.

60
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:41,233
I know.

61
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:46,671
But it's Russia. They do things
differently over there.

62
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,842
Me, too.

63
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:54,813

<i>Your best friend.</i>

169
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,565
Jack!

170
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,068
Dad?

171
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,876
Get out of the van!

172
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,247
What are you doing here?

173
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:10,882
Jack! Hey!

174
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,619
Jack!

175
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,457
Shit.

176
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:22,260
<i>Komarov! Komarov!</i>

177
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:23,194
<i>Quick... get the truck!</i>

178
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:24,996
<i>Quick... get the truck!</i>

179
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:25,863
Go home.

180
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,899
What the fuck do you think...? Jack!

181
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:29,700
You're out of your depth, John.

182
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:32,170
Jack! What are you doing?

183
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:37,074
No! No!

184
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,843
<i>We need him alive!</i>

185
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:40,444
Jack!

186
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:43,447
You're gonna shoot me?

187
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:47,151
You're gonna shoot your own father?

188
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:50,288
You shouldn't be here, John.

189
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,456
You shouldn't be here.

190
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,892
What are you doing?

191
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,233
Jack!

192
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:04,902
Whoa!

193
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:07,138
You're gonna fucking run over me?

194
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,473
You're only making it worse!

195
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:10,741
Jack.

196
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,155
Get out of the way!

197
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,292
Call a cop!

198
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,367
Reaper One? Reaper One from 6-1-0.

199
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:39,070
Who's got him? Clock's running. Foxy.

200
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,204
On the paper now. Box on.

201
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:41,973
Copy that. Box on.
<i>- Okay, here we go.</i>

202
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:45,309
<i>6-1, Reaper, we read you. Go ahead.</i>

203
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:46,711
Reaper, how are we looking?

204
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:47,345
Your guy is late.

205
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:49,680
His rate of progress is way off.

206
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:51,749
MET now plus 6 minutes.

207
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,587
MCC Reaper. MET now plus 6.

208
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:57,622
This is un-frigging-believable.

209
00:20:57,624 --> 00:20:59,390
MCC Reaper. That's not how it works.

210
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:01,759
Something's off. I know this
guy. This doesn't happen.

211
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:04,862
MCC Reaper, 6-1 is in the hole. Stand by.

212
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:07,131
6-1, be advised, your window is closed.

213
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:08,499
Time on target is no-go.

214
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:10,001
I say again, TOT is no-go.

215
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:13,938
Reaper, this is real-world,
not exercise, do you copy?

216
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,174
No, sir, Moscow police will have
shut down the Garden Ring.

217
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:19,543
Reaper! He's no-go for extraction.

218
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:21,345
It's too late. Shut it down. Pull it!

219
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:24,415
6-1, mission window is closed.
Reaper is out of here.

220
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:26,784
Come on!

221
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,185
Shit!

222
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,454
Get me Operations.

223
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,489
Reaper!

224
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:32,523
Get Mike Collins looped in.

225
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:35,726
Tell him it's Plan B, safehouse. Go now!

226
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:37,461
Plan B. No choice.

227
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:38,062
Shit.

228
00:21:38,064 --> 00:21:41,565
It's blown. They shut the Garden Ring.

229
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,770
Harvest is in effect. Keep on working.

230
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:47,405
Let's finish this, Foxy.

231
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:50,808
Damn you, McClane!

232
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,443
Damn you!

233
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:21,472
Oh, fuck!

234
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:24,608
Jack! I'm not done talking to you!

235
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:29,613
Who is this?

236
00:22:29,615 --> 00:22:31,148
Come on, go!

237
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:50,968
Concentrate, please.

238
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:12,189
That's right, come on through, yeah!

239
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:13,958
See if you can hit this guy!

240
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:30,541
Jesus!

241
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,069
I'm tired of this guy.

242
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:01,205
RPG now!

243
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,343
Jesus!

244
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,868
You missed! Interesting choice, man.

245
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,252
Hey, hey!

246
00:24:48,254 --> 00:24:49,487
Hey!

247
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:50,921
Whoa!

248
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:52,623
Hey! Whoa!

249
00:24:59,364 --> 00:24:59,864
Come on!

250
00:24:59,866 --> 00:25:02,433
You gotta be fucking kidding me!

251
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:06,670
What?

252
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:13,444
Do you think I understand
a word you're saying?

253
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:17,848
Jesus Christ.

254
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:21,452
It's okay, I'm fine, thanks.

255
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:31,695
Oh, man, you're driving like my grandma!

256
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:35,099
When I say drive, I mean fly!

257
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:47,144
Oh, yeah!

258
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,668
Get out of the way!

259
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:12,770
Oh, God.

260
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:19,677
Jesus!

261
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:32,523
Oh, for the love of...

262
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:34,758
Hi, honey.
<i>- Dad? Can you hear me?</i>

263
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,261
<i>How is Moscow? Can I call you back?</i>

264
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:38,696
<i>Wait, don't...</i>

265
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:45,269
Sorry, ma'am!

266
00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:51,408
Sorry!

267
00:27:33,753 --> 00:27:36,353
Did you see this guy?

268
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,990
<i>Dad, can you hear me?</i>

269
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,092
<i>Dad, are you still there?</i>

270
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:43,460
<i>Dad?</i>

271
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:50,334
Oh, man!

272
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,869
Knock knock.

273
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:56,740
You still there?

274
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:58,308
<i>Yeah, I'm here.</i>

275
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:01,045
<i>So, how is Jack? Have you seen him?</i>

276
00:28:01,047 --> 00:28:03,447
Uh, yep, looking right at him.

277
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:04,348
<i>Is he okay?</i>

278
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:08,285
I haven't really caught up with
him yet, but he looks good.

279
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,654
I'm gonna have to call you back.

280
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:11,955
<i>What's going on there?</i>

281
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:13,657
Luce, can I call you right back?

282
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:15,159
<i>Don't hang up...</i>

283
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,898
Guess who!

284
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:36,580
I've had enough of this shit.

285
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:42,219
Oh, man, hey!

286
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,589
Is that it? Is that your best shot?

287
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,789
Damn you, John.

288
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:21,492
Damn you!

289
00:29:56,929 --> 00:29:58,629
Hey! Up here!

290
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,932
Shoot up here!

291
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:08,172
John! Get in!

292
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:11,542
Get in before I change my mind. Jesus!

293
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:14,845
Take your time.

294
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,685
Jack, what the fuck was that, huh?

295
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:23,520
Shut up. Shut up, John.

296
00:30:23,522 --> 00:30:25,956
I swear to God, I will put
a bullet in you this time.

297
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:27,758
Who do you think you're talking to?

298
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,193
The last person I want to see.

299
00:30:29,195 --> 00:30:30,828
Well, maybe you missed the
whole part back there

300
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,896
where I saved you and Papa Geppetto here

301
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:35,299
from a whole bunch of Russian bad guys.

302
00:30:35,301 --> 00:30:37,501
You saved? You saved?

303
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:38,969
That's right, saved.

304
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:41,138
Shut up. Shut up.

305
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,106
You're a world class screw-up,
you know that, John?

306
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:46,043
I'm a screw-up? I'm a screw-up?

307
00:30:46,045 --> 00:30:46,743
I'm still your father.

308
00:30:46,745 --> 00:30:49,246
Yeah, nothing I can do about that.

309
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:49,913
What a joke.

310
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:51,915
Just shut up. Try not to touch
anything, all right?

311
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:54,318
You've done enough goddamn damage.

312
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:58,288
<i>The appointment is next week...</i>

313
00:30:58,290 --> 00:30:59,456
<i>We will begin immediately.</i>

314
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:02,025
<i>Excuse me, sir. Komarov has escaped.</i>

315
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:05,062
<i>I'll call you back. There is</i>
<i>a problem with Komarov.</i>

316
00:31:05,064 --> 00:31:05,762
<i>What happened?</i>

317
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:08,198
<i>Some sort of attack on the courthouse.</i>

318
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,266
<i>Who took him?</i>

319
00:31:09,268 --> 00:31:10,467
<i>They don't know yet.</i>

320
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:12,636
<i>What do you mean you don't know?</i>

321
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:13,337
<i>Eh...</i>

322
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:14,872
<i>...well it's confusing...</i>

323
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:18,408
<i>Eyewitnesses say they saw Komarov...</i>

324
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,111
<i>...with an American.</i>

325
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,581
<i>What American?</i>

326
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:29,686
John McClane.

327
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:33,223
Let's go.

328
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:37,594
After you.

329
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:40,097
Yeah, I got him. Okay, I'm on it.

330
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:43,333
Look, Mike, we had an unexpected
delay. I'm sorry.

331
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:43,800
I understand.

332
00:31:43,802 --> 00:31:46,036
This is the last guy on earth
I expected to see.

333
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:48,705
Listen to me, Yuri, you have half
of Moscow looking for you.

334
00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:50,641
I need you to get dressed. Why am I here?

335
00:31:50,643 --> 00:31:53,510
Please put on these clothes. Trust me.

336
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:56,346
This is the key to your
cuffs. Take these.

337
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:57,514
Oh, my Jesus.

338
00:31:57,516 --> 00:31:58,916
Are you okay? What?

339
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:02,152
Do you have the file on Chagarin?

340
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:05,622
This is what you been doing, Jack?

341
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,457
Spy shit?

342
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:10,627
This is it?

343
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:14,464
You're a spy? Oh, my God.

344
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:20,003
The 007 of Plainfield, New Jersey.

345
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,505
Very nice.

346
00:32:21,507 --> 00:32:23,941
McClane, shut up.

347
00:32:23,943 --> 00:32:25,742
Take it easy, Oddjob.

348
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:27,477
I'm on vacation.

349
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:28,578
Your mom will be pleased.

350
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,181
We thought you were doing
drugs or something.

351
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:31,715
Mr. Komarov.

352
00:32:31,717 --> 00:32:35,185
Or selling drugs, but
that was me, really.

353
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:38,689
Do you have the file on Chagarin?

354
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,824
Yes, or no?

355
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,026
It's very simple, Yuri.

356
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:46,330
You give me the file, and
I get you out of Russia.

357
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:50,033
And you're a free man. What do you say?

358
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:56,173
It's not about me. I don't
care about my life.

359
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,608
Well, that's the deal.

360
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,344
It's the only deal.

361
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:03,347
Come on.

362
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:07,050
Come on, Yuri. Help yourself.

363
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,286
What's it gonna be?

364
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,589
Yes or no?

365
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:16,126
The clock is ticking, Yuri. Come on.

366
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:18,829
You will get me out of here?

367
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:19,696
Only the three of you?

368
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:21,832
Whoa, Nijinsky. I'm not in the gang.

369
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:24,468
I just got off the plane.
I'm still jet-lagged.

370
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:28,305
I'm not involved in this. Huh, Jack?

371
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:33,510
Only if I can take my daughter with me.

372
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:39,082
Chagarin's people will kill her.

373
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:43,553
Fine. Make it quick.

374
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:45,355
Ah.

375
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,923
Where's the file?

376
00:33:46,925 --> 00:33:50,827
It's in a vault in Prypiat, but
the key is here in Moscow.

377
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:52,429
At Hotel Ukraina.

378
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:59,903
Make your call. We're going
to the Ukraina, let's go.

379
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:08,578
<i>It's papa...</i>

380
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:11,948
<i>I'm fine, Sunshine...</i>

381
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,583
<i>...we'll talk later.</i>

382
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:14,484
<i>Listen.</i>

383
00:34:14,486 --> 00:34:18,221
<i>I'll be waiting for you where your mother</i>
<i>and I shared our first dance.</i>

384
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,456
<i>Now.</i>

385
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,926
<i>Hurry! Hurry! You understand?</i>

386
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:36,206
Mike, listen, I'm sorry about
this morning, man.

387
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,910
It's fine.

388
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:43,413
Okay, let's go.

389
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:48,919
Contact!

390
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:53,156
Down! Get down!

391
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:55,358
Go! Get down! Go, go, go!

392
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,130
John, cover!

393
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:16,880
Come on, buddy!

394
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:21,284
Go! Go!

395
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:29,092
That's right, jerk-off!

396
00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:30,460
All right, let's move, John!

397
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:31,795
I'm on fucking vacation!

398
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:34,464
Come on, time to hustle. Watch your head.

399
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
McClane, move it.

400
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:39,569
8,000 fucking miles for this?

401
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:46,276
Get down, Yuri. Stay low!

402
00:35:46,278 --> 00:35:47,544
Head down.

403
00:35:47,546 --> 00:35:49,646
Come on. Go, go!

404
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:04,995
Safe house, my ass.

405
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:11,635
He knows how old we are, no?

406
00:36:11,637 --> 00:36:12,969
Come on.

407
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:18,742
Here, here, here.

408
00:36:18,744 --> 00:36:21,178
Sit down. You're all right.

409
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,679
Let me look at you.

410
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,548
It's all right. You're fine.

411
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,449
What are you doing?

412
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:27,984
Jack.

413
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:30,387
Calm down, Yuri, okay? You're
gonna be just fine.

414
00:36:30,389 --> 00:36:33,823
Here, put this on, stay warm.

415
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:37,727
What was that, John? Five
minutes? Five minutes?

416
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:39,596
You blew a three-year op in five minutes!

417
00:36:39,598 --> 00:36:41,765
You're welcome! What do
you want me to do?

418
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:44,935
Unbelievable.

419
00:36:44,937 --> 00:36:45,368
Unbelievable.

420
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:48,605
I'm so fucking burned. I got no
friends in this town anymore.

421
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:52,342
What about your people at Langley?
Just give them a call.

422
00:36:52,344 --> 00:36:55,045
Give me your phone.

423
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:04,354
It's a two-year contract on that phone.

424
00:37:04,356 --> 00:37:07,290
What are you carrying? Give me that.

425
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:10,927
All right. You got any cash on you?

426
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:12,662
Some American money.

427
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:15,432
What are you talking about?
We need to keep on moving.

428
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:19,736
We have to get this guy to a doctor.
To medical attention, Jack.

429
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:20,370
The mission stands.

430
00:37:20,372 --> 00:37:22,973
Your mission is bleeding out over there.

431
00:37:22,975 --> 00:37:26,009
The mission continues.
We go to the hotel.

432
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:33,383
Come on, let's move. Let's move.

433
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:45,295
This is nuts.

434
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:47,264
What, are you going to go out
and kill somebody else now?

435
00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:49,566
Why all this trouble for just one guy?

436
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:51,901
He's a political prisoner.

437
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:52,535
Not that you care, John,

438
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:54,838
but it's a matter of national
security, all right?

439
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:59,376
He's got the goods to stop Viktor Chagarin,
and we need that to happen.

440
00:37:59,378 --> 00:37:59,976
Well, great, Jack.

441
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:01,845
Let's drop him off at the Embassy,
and we can go home.

442
00:38:01,847 --> 00:38:05,582
Are you kidding me? After what
happened at the safe house?

443
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,183
Look, it doesn't work
like that, all right?

444
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:09,653
It's a huge diplomatic mess,
and I'm a burnable asset.

445
00:38:09,655 --> 00:38:13,123
So, I now need that file
to un-fuck this mission.

446
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:14,457
Any more questions?

447
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:15,392
Yeah, just one.

448
00:38:15,394 --> 00:38:18,528
How come you never called and
told me where you were?

449
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:20,730
Like you'd give a shit.

450
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:34,244
All right, hold up, hold up.

451
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:40,717
Okay, Yuri, listen to me, all
right? We're almost done.

452
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:43,019
As soon as we get that key,
we're gonna grab the file,

453
00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:46,022
get you and your daughter
out of Russia, all right?

454
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:47,691
All right.

455
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:51,761
Listen to me, you're doing
good. All right?

456
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:55,131
I need you to hang here a second.
Keep an eye on him, John.

457
00:38:55,133 --> 00:38:55,498
Hey, hey.

458
00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:00,370
What is it with all this "John" shit?
Whatever happened to "Dad?"

459
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:02,706
Good question.

460
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:08,578
In Russia, we have word for men like him.

461
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,847
<i>"Krutoi."</i>

462
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:14,217
It means "tough," "hard."

463
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:18,455
In America, it means "juvenile
delinquent."

464
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,625
Is he your only child?

465
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:27,063
No. I got a daughter, too.

466
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:30,100
You?

467
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:35,605
<i>I have only my Solnyschka.</i>

468
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:39,976
When she was little, I was
working all the time.

469
00:39:39,978 --> 00:39:43,913
I believed work was all that mattered.

470
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:51,588
I screwed my kid's life up, too.

471
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:52,155
You work all the time

472
00:39:52,157 --> 00:39:55,091
around the clock most of the
time, when you're a cop.

473
00:39:55,093 --> 00:40:01,931
I just thought that working all the
time was a good thing, you know?

474
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:09,439
I didn't help him at all.

475
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:14,444
It's never too late,

476
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:16,946
I hope.

477
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:21,751
Okay, let's go.

478
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,596
All right, Yuri, which part of the
building is the ballroom in?

479
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:34,497
Main tower.

480
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:36,499
Main tower. Which floor?

481
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:37,500
Top floor.

482
00:40:37,502 --> 00:40:39,035
Top floor.

483
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:39,636
What about security?

484
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:42,272
You remember any guards? Cameras?
Anything like that?

485
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:44,073
I don't know.

486
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:45,275
Well, I need you to remember.

487
00:40:45,277 --> 00:40:47,577
I was in prison for five years,
how should I know?

488
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,546
Everything could have changed. I know.

489
00:40:49,548 --> 00:40:53,183
Just think, all right? Picture
it in your head.

490
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:55,318
The ballroom was closed in '89.

491
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,720
I think it's under construction now.

492
00:40:57,722 --> 00:40:58,955
So that floor's unsecured.

493
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:01,591
I don't know! Listen! My
daughter is in there.

494
00:41:01,593 --> 00:41:02,992
I'm scared to death, let's go!

495
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:05,295
Just calm down, Yuri.

496
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:32,922
I guess you have done that before.

497
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:36,893
Smart.

498
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,764
I could have done it.

499
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:26,709
Irina?

500
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:29,746
Irina?

501
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:37,654
Irina?

502
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:43,793
Papa.

503
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:49,132
Irina. Papa!

504
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:54,170
That's tender.

505
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:56,673
Really? I wouldn't know.

506
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:08,618
Need a hug?

507
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:13,323
We're not really a hugging family.

508
00:43:13,325 --> 00:43:15,158
That's right.

509
00:43:15,894 --> 00:43:18,194
<i>We just have to get one thing...</i>

510
00:43:18,196 --> 00:43:21,130
<i>...and then we're leaving</i>
<i>Moscow for good.</i>

511
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:22,498
<i>OK?</i>

512
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:23,366
<i>OK.</i>

513
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:32,342
<i>Who are they?</i>

514
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:37,480
The young one works for CIA.

515
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:41,084
The old one is his father. Americans.

516
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:43,987
<i>Then thank God for them.</i>

517
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:47,857
There's something no good about this.

518
00:43:47,859 --> 00:43:49,993
Just shut up, all right?

519
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:52,862
I'm telling you, Jack,

520
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,264
this smells bad.

521
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:58,167
Just stop, okay?

522
00:43:58,169 --> 00:44:02,839
This might seem like a totally
foreign concept, you know?

523
00:44:02,841 --> 00:44:05,341
I know you love to just
run in, making shit up.

524
00:44:05,343 --> 00:44:07,310
But like any professional, I have a plan.

525
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:09,445
So let's just stick to it, okay?

526
00:44:09,447 --> 00:44:10,546
Just move your plan along.

527
00:44:10,548 --> 00:44:13,683
All right, Yuri, come on. Let's
grab the key, get out of here.

528
00:44:13,685 --> 00:44:15,351
Yes.

529
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:17,820
Just take a moment.

530
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:37,306
How you doing?

531
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,411
Fine.

532
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:53,156
How did you get over here so quick?

533
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,694
Well...

534
00:44:58,162 --> 00:45:00,496
I took Garden Ring.

535
00:45:00,498 --> 00:45:05,835
Oh, the Garden Ring. Supposed
to always be bad, right?

536
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:16,746
Hey, John.

537
00:45:16,748 --> 00:45:18,514
Did you get stuck in traffic?

538
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:23,119
I have it! I have it.

539
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:28,224
Welcome, Americans.

540
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:36,499
Put your goddamn guns down, asshole!

541
00:45:44,776 --> 00:45:47,310
<i>Papa, what is going on?</i>

542
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:52,615
Give me your weapons.

543
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:54,550
Come and get them.

544
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,258
Really?

545
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:04,594
Really.

546
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:08,464
Papa.

547
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:12,135
Yuri.

548
00:46:12,137 --> 00:46:13,636
Do it.

549
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:17,607
I thought you were a problem child.

550
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:38,628
This a part of your plan,
Mr. Professional?

551
00:46:40,999 --> 00:46:42,698
<i>What are you doing?</i>

552
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:44,867
<i>It's about money, papa...</i>

553
00:46:44,869 --> 00:46:46,369
<i>...millions of dollars.</i>

554
00:46:46,371 --> 00:46:47,570
<i>You think life was easy for me?</i>

555
00:46:47,572 --> 00:46:50,606
<i>While you were sitting in</i>
<i>prison being a victim?</i>

556
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:52,742
But,

557
00:46:52,744 --> 00:46:55,545
I'm your father.

558
00:46:57,014 --> 00:46:59,148
And I am your daughter.

559
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:02,351
We should kill the old man now.

560
00:47:02,353 --> 00:47:04,020
We still need him.

561
00:47:04,022 --> 00:47:05,888
But them you can kill.

562
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:07,857
Thank you.

563
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:12,161
Hi.

564
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:15,998
I don't know if I'm saying this right.

565
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:18,501
Hi.

566
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:24,540
Do you know what I hate
about the Americans?

567
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,976
Everything.

568
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:30,546
Especially cowboys.

569
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:53,569
I could have been a dancer.
I swear to God.

570
00:47:57,741 --> 00:48:00,776
But nobody supported me.

571
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:06,315
You two

572
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:11,187
have been such a

573
00:48:11,189 --> 00:48:14,624
pain in the ass!

574
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:33,609
I prefer dancing, really.

575
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:39,949
But killing is much, much better
than working in a grocery shop!

576
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:45,388
Jesus Christ!

577
00:48:47,725 --> 00:48:48,858
Nice one.

578
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:05,074
You guys. So arrogant.

579
00:49:05,076 --> 00:49:07,576
It's not 1986, you know.

580
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:11,547
Reagan is dead.

581
00:49:18,756 --> 00:49:21,857
Sorry. Oh, God.

582
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:33,135
What's funny there?

583
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:34,971
Can't tell you.

584
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:38,474
It's not you. I love these outfits.

585
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:41,811
You guys are looking good.

586
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:51,854
That was enough, thank you.

587
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:56,459
Let's dance.

588
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:15,211
Come on! Come on!

589
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:28,324
Jack!

590
00:50:28,326 --> 00:50:32,294
Remember the last time we talked
just before you went away?

591
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:34,397
Oh, no! No, no!

592
00:50:34,399 --> 00:50:38,067
You're not gonna open up to
me right before we die!

593
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:41,270
No, that's not your thing, John.

594
00:50:41,272 --> 00:50:41,871
What's my thing?

595
00:50:41,873 --> 00:50:45,241
Fucking killing bad guys,
that's your thing!

596
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:48,577
You're not gonna die today!

597
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,706
Go!

598
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:51,173
Shit!

599
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:52,942
Fuck.

600
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:55,678
We're finished, John.

601
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:06,822
I can't believe this.

602
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:15,965
I can't believe this.
This is unbelievable.

603
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:26,575
Jack. Hey!

604
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:35,484
Jesus!

605
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,222
Come on!

606
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:49,098
Let's get out of this building!

607
00:53:04,749 --> 00:53:05,814
<i>Where are they?</i>

608
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,353
Come on.

609
00:53:35,413 --> 00:53:37,513
<i>Alik, that's it. We're done!</i>

610
00:53:37,515 --> 00:53:38,214
<i>Let's go!</i>

611
00:53:38,216 --> 00:53:39,215
<i>Break left!</i>

612
00:53:39,217 --> 00:53:40,349
<i>Copy, Commander.</i>

613
00:54:14,318 --> 00:54:15,618
<i>Do you have him?</i>

614
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:16,952
Yes.

615
00:54:16,954 --> 00:54:18,053
<i>And the file?</i>

616
00:54:18,055 --> 00:54:20,055
<i>Does he have it?</i>

617
00:54:20,057 --> 00:54:22,625
<i>I need that file, Alik.</i>

618
00:54:22,627 --> 00:54:24,660
He's taking us to it.

619
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:28,364
<i>No more mistakes, Alik.</i>

620
00:54:28,366 --> 00:54:30,699
<i>And when you have the file...</i>

621
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:33,235
<i>...kill them both.</i>

622
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:35,938
Yes, sir.

623
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:55,257
Shit.

624
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:01,830
That was exciting.

625
00:55:01,832 --> 00:55:04,800
Yeah. Loads of fun.

626
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:07,970
You wanna go again?

627
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,274
Are you shot?

628
00:55:12,276 --> 00:55:13,442
No.

629
00:55:13,543 --> 00:55:15,144
No, I'm fine.

630
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:17,413
Let me take a look at that.

631
00:55:17,415 --> 00:55:19,448
It's fine.

632
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:20,883
Oh, fuck.

633
00:55:20,885 --> 00:55:25,220
I can't believe she betrayed
her father for Chagarin.

634
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:28,824
I don't understand that.

635
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:32,828
Someday you will.

636
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:35,064
Kids.

637
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:40,703
What's our next move?

638
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:43,005
I don't know.

639
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:45,040
You don't know? I don't know, all right?

640
00:55:45,042 --> 00:55:48,077
I mean, I'm out of moves. I don't know.

641
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,012
I don't know.

642
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:53,015
I screwed up.

643
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:55,484
I blew the mission.

644
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:04,927
Well, then we're done, right?

645
00:56:04,929 --> 00:56:06,028
Yeah, we're done.

646
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:07,429
We're done.

647
00:56:07,431 --> 00:56:08,997
We should just go home.

648
00:56:08,999 --> 00:56:12,201
We'll stop by a little pharmacy
on our way out of Moscow,

649
00:56:12,203 --> 00:56:16,071
get you some Merthiolate or mercury

650
00:56:16,073 --> 00:56:17,906
and fix up your little scratches, here.

651
00:56:17,908 --> 00:56:20,843
Get you home. Get a little toy set.

652
00:56:20,845 --> 00:56:25,280
Get yourself a nice warm glass of
milk with a little Bosco in it.

653
00:56:25,282 --> 00:56:27,182
Get your CIA slippers.

654
00:56:27,184 --> 00:56:28,384
All right.

655
00:56:28,386 --> 00:56:30,519
What? I get it.

656
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:33,555
What the hell are we gonna do?

657
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:36,225
What's in the file?

658
00:56:36,227 --> 00:56:39,261
Evidence on Chagarin.

659
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:44,600
Evidence about what?

660
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:47,736
Chernobyl.

661
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:51,306
Look, listen to me.

662
00:56:51,308 --> 00:56:53,142
Komarov and Chagarin used to have this

663
00:56:53,144 --> 00:56:58,747
nasty little side-racket going
on back in the day.

664
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:03,952
They siphoned weapons-grade
uranium, got greedy,

665
00:57:04,053 --> 00:57:06,989
caused the meltdown.

666
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:11,326
Then, you know, they fell out.

667
00:57:11,328 --> 00:57:14,596
Former partners, bad break-up.

668
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:17,800
Scumbags.

669
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,802
So, Chagarin had Komarov thrown in jail.

670
00:57:19,804 --> 00:57:23,038
You know, put him in a hole,
forget about him.

671
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,607
Doesn't have to worry anymore.

672
00:57:26,342 --> 00:57:29,311
So what happened to rescuesque?

673
00:57:29,313 --> 00:57:32,114
Well, he grew a conscience.

674
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:35,717
Yeah, well, that figures.

675
00:57:35,719 --> 00:57:39,655
Listen, Chagarin is bad news.
He's the real deal.

676
00:57:39,657 --> 00:57:44,526
If we see this guy in control, we're gonna
see the whole thing fall apart.

677
00:57:44,528 --> 00:57:48,130
I'm talking terrorism,

678
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:50,199
WMDs,

679
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,201
nukes.

680
00:57:55,538 --> 00:57:58,507
Someone has to stop him.

681
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:02,678
Well, that's what we do.

682
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:09,051
We go out to Chiapep and we do our thing.

683
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:12,087
Our thing?

684
00:58:12,089 --> 00:58:13,388
Yeah.

685
00:58:13,857 --> 00:58:17,192
We go out there and kill
a lot of scumbags.

686
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:25,968
What? You got something better to do?

687
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:29,137
All right. Pull it.

688
00:58:29,139 --> 00:58:31,406
You're not gonna cry, are you?

689
00:58:31,408 --> 00:58:32,774
Just pull it.

690
00:58:32,776 --> 00:58:35,677
Everybody needs a good cry
once in a while, Jack.

691
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:37,713
Don't be ashamed. Pull it.

692
00:58:37,715 --> 00:58:38,514
You remember that time when

693
00:58:38,516 --> 00:58:43,385
you and Ralphie Mauser were gonna
have that house-painting job?

694
00:58:43,387 --> 00:58:44,887
Got your finger caught in the ladder,

695
00:58:44,889 --> 00:58:46,788
you cried for about five, six days.

696
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:48,590
John, just pull it!

697
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:50,859
All right.

698
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:53,228
On three. Here you go.

699
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:55,531
One, two...

700
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:01,570
Good God.

701
00:59:01,572 --> 00:59:03,438
Jesus.

702
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:07,309
When was the last time you
had a tetanus shot?

703
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:14,283
You all right?

704
00:59:14,285 --> 00:59:15,651
Yeah.

705
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:18,587
We need a car.

706
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:20,522
Atta boy.

707
00:59:20,524 --> 00:59:22,391
Back to work.

708
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:44,580
Hey, Watergate, how's that lock coming?

709
00:59:44,582 --> 00:59:46,315
Almost there.

710
00:59:46,317 --> 00:59:48,584
Here, try these.

711
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:50,252
Come on.

712
00:59:50,254 --> 00:59:52,821
Oh, stealing. That's nice.
Real nice, John.

713
00:59:52,823 --> 00:59:56,391
Yeah, I'm up for the Father
of the Year award.

714
00:59:58,361 --> 00:59:59,661
Whoa.

715
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:02,864
All right.

716
01:00:02,866 --> 01:00:05,467
How'd you know all of these
guns were gonna be here?

717
01:00:05,469 --> 01:00:07,369
It's a Chechen hangout.

718
01:00:07,371 --> 01:00:09,204
Owner doesn't like guns in the club,

719
01:00:09,206 --> 01:00:11,573
so these bozos leave them in their cars.

720
01:00:11,575 --> 01:00:13,942
You learn a lot in three years.

721
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:15,210
Yeah.

722
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,485
Are we really going to Chernobyl?

723
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:25,554
Yeah.

724
01:00:26,322 --> 01:00:27,990
The Chernobyl.

725
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:30,125
The radioactive joint? Meltdown?

726
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:32,194
That's the one.

727
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,997
It's not the Chernobyl
in Switzerland, right?

728
01:00:34,999 --> 01:00:38,834
With all the skiing and the
snow and everything?

729
01:00:38,836 --> 01:00:41,370
You mean Grenoble?

730
01:00:41,738 --> 01:00:45,741
No, sorry, we're not going to Grenoble.

731
01:00:51,447 --> 01:00:54,850
Eddie Collins's kid took him
on vacation last year.

732
01:00:54,852 --> 01:00:56,551
They went down to Boca.

733
01:00:56,553 --> 01:00:57,386
Oh, yeah?

734
01:00:57,388 --> 01:00:58,820
Spent four days at the track.

735
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:00,922
Well, that's nice.

736
01:01:00,924 --> 01:01:02,724
That's relaxing.

737
01:01:02,726 --> 01:01:05,627
Oh, yeah. Sure.

738
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,697
We have to go to Chernobyl?

739
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:10,632
Yeah, sorry about that.

740
01:01:10,634 --> 01:01:14,436
But all the radioactive
stuff is out, right?

741
01:01:49,707 --> 01:01:52,207
<i>Is it as you remember, papa?</i>

742
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:54,009
<i>I don't want to remember.</i>

743
01:01:55,845 --> 01:01:56,945
<i>Tough.</i>

744
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:00,282
<i>The file...</i>

745
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:02,184
<i>...is in the inner vault.</i>

746
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:07,656
Very touching. Let's move.

747
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:33,582
Which one is it?

748
01:02:33,584 --> 01:02:36,418
<i>Get moving, old goat.</i>

749
01:02:52,835 --> 01:02:57,739
Couple of fresh coats of paint and
a weedwacker and it's good to go.

750
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:07,883
You know, at first, they denied
anything even happened.

751
01:03:07,885 --> 01:03:10,719
Held a children's parade the
next day to prove it.

752
01:03:10,721 --> 01:03:16,057
24 hours later, 50,000 residents
were evacuated.

753
01:03:16,492 --> 01:03:18,894
Never came back.

754
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:23,799
As soon as they get in that vault,
Komarov's a dead man.

755
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:27,969
All right.

756
01:04:11,814 --> 01:04:14,015
You got a plan?

757
01:04:14,817 --> 01:04:16,318
Not really.

758
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:18,620
I kind of thought we'd just wing it.

759
01:04:18,622 --> 01:04:24,359
You know, run in, guns blazing,
making shit up as we go.

760
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:26,728
Yeah? Yeah.

761
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:31,766
What is this? A pirate gun?

762
01:04:31,768 --> 01:04:34,703
Yeah. It's old school, man.

763
01:04:34,705 --> 01:04:36,204
Like you, right?

764
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:38,206
Yeah, like me.

765
01:04:39,909 --> 01:04:43,979
One of these days, I'm gonna
have a long talk with you.

766
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:02,264
Look, Jack,

767
01:05:02,665 --> 01:05:05,500
I'm sorry your partner got killed.

768
01:05:06,302 --> 01:05:11,506
I'm sorry I fucked up your
day. That wasn't my plan.

769
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:14,075
I caused you problems.

770
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:18,413
You know, I came here for something else.

771
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:25,186
And all that other bullshit. I mean,

772
01:05:28,357 --> 01:05:30,759
I had a pretty good day.

773
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:36,097
It's fun, running around with you.

774
01:05:41,504 --> 01:05:43,705
It's good to see you.

775
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:52,213
I love you, boy.

776
01:05:57,586 --> 01:05:59,387
You, too.

777
01:06:00,756 --> 01:06:03,825
I want you to know I got your back.

778
01:06:06,996 --> 01:06:09,497
I got yours, too.

779
01:06:13,002 --> 01:06:17,272
All right. Let's go kill
some motherfuckers.

780
01:06:38,729 --> 01:06:39,494
<i>Key.</i>

781
01:08:02,611 --> 01:08:05,480
Okay, what the fuck is this?

782
01:08:05,482 --> 01:08:09,984
I'm losing my patience. The fucking
file better be here.

783
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:17,225
Radiation has been pooling
in this room for decades.

784
01:08:18,662 --> 01:08:22,297
You've underestimated us, Daddy dearest.

785
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:24,699
<i>Bring it in!</i>

786
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:09,978
Atta boy.

787
01:09:15,152 --> 01:09:15,884
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>

788
01:09:15,886 --> 01:09:22,557
Compound 27-4. It neutralizes
radiation, trust me.

789
01:09:35,638 --> 01:09:38,840
What's this remind you of?

790
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:41,543
Newark.

791
01:10:00,129 --> 01:10:04,566
All clear. We can ditch the suits.

792
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:31,726
The hell is that?

793
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:37,098
One billion euros worth
of enriched uranium.

794
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:40,134
What?

795
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:44,205
Don't worry, it's stable in this form.

796
01:10:44,207 --> 01:10:45,540
File!

797
01:10:46,775 --> 01:10:50,712
Irina, cut the crap, please.

798
01:10:50,714 --> 01:10:55,016
No one here is speaking about
uranium. Where's the file?

799
01:10:55,719 --> 01:10:58,786
No more games, where is the file?

800
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:07,095
That's no longer your concern.

801
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:32,887
<i>Sunshine...</i>

802
01:11:33,355 --> 01:11:34,789
<i>...you did well.</i>

803
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:39,894
<i>I told you...</i>

804
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:41,796
<i>...everything would work out.</i>

805
01:11:44,533 --> 01:11:45,867
<i>Come to papa.</i>

806
01:11:59,082 --> 01:12:00,748
<i>Pap, you're a genius.</i>

807
01:12:02,017 --> 01:12:02,917
<i>I know.</i>

808
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:08,890
<i>Load it up.</i>

809
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:12,760
<i>Pegasus?</i>

810
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:14,562
<i>Do you copy?</i>

811
01:13:02,811 --> 01:13:05,880
A lot of hardware for a file.

812
01:13:14,457 --> 01:13:16,357
<i>Wheels up in five minutes.</i>

813
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:17,959
<i>Perfect.</i>

814
01:13:58,902 --> 01:13:59,500
<i>Here you go, sir.</i>

815
01:13:59,502 --> 01:14:02,670
<i>Team extraction completed.</i>
<i>She's all yours.</i>

816
01:14:02,871 --> 01:14:03,638
<i>Good.</i>

817
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:35,536
<i>Are you inside?</i>

818
01:14:35,704 --> 01:14:37,004
<i>Yes, yes, Viktor.</i>

819
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:40,641
<i>I'm inside.</i>

820
01:14:43,245 --> 01:14:44,579
<i>Yuri?</i>

821
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:46,981
<i>You surprised?</i>

822
01:14:48,283 --> 01:14:51,752
<i>I'm in the same place where</i>
<i>it all started...</i>

823
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:54,255
<i>...before you betrayed me.</i>

824
01:14:54,756 --> 01:14:55,923
<i>Remember...</i>

825
01:14:56,892 --> 01:15:00,394
<i>...you promised to give me my life back.</i>

826
01:15:01,096 --> 01:15:02,897
<i>You gave it back to me.</i>

827
01:15:04,132 --> 01:15:05,600
<i>I thank you for that.</i>

828
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:09,370
<i>And now...</i>

829
01:15:09,372 --> 01:15:11,405
<i>...I'm going to take yours.</i>

830
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:43,170
<i>Static 4, we are ready for take off.</i>

831
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:47,742
<i>Static 4, do you copy?</i>

832
01:15:52,681 --> 01:15:54,415
Yuri!

833
01:15:57,853 --> 01:15:59,186
Yuri.

834
01:15:59,188 --> 01:16:01,856
Where's the dancer?

835
01:16:01,858 --> 01:16:04,592
You okay? You hurt?

836
01:16:04,594 --> 01:16:06,327
No.

837
01:16:08,931 --> 01:16:10,197
I'm good.

838
01:16:13,468 --> 01:16:15,503
I'm all right.

839
01:16:19,675 --> 01:16:22,610
What's in these boxes?

840
01:16:25,047 --> 01:16:27,615
Thank God you're here, Jack.

841
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:29,617
We have to leave.

842
01:16:29,619 --> 01:16:31,819
They're coming back any minute.

843
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:36,857
Just let me get the file.

844
01:16:36,859 --> 01:16:38,893
What's in the boxes?

845
01:16:41,997 --> 01:16:44,632
It's U-235.

846
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:48,736
Weapons-grade uranium.

847
01:16:50,339 --> 01:16:52,707
Armored cases.

848
01:16:57,980 --> 01:16:59,747
The bomb kind?

849
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:03,851
Yeah, the bomb kind.

850
01:17:09,191 --> 01:17:10,992
Not so fast, Eddie.

851
01:17:10,994 --> 01:17:12,526
Are you crazy?

852
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:14,695
Yeah, a little bit.

853
01:17:14,697 --> 01:17:16,530
I'm getting the file.

854
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:20,735
No. No, you're not.

855
01:17:20,737 --> 01:17:24,338
The key. It's your vault, isn't it, Yuri?

856
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:27,441
What? No. No, I...

857
01:17:27,443 --> 01:17:29,844
You put this shit in here, right?

858
01:17:29,846 --> 01:17:31,078
What? No.

859
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:32,313
Right?

860
01:17:32,381 --> 01:17:34,715
I didn't know, Jack.

861
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:45,126
Is that the dancer down there?

862
01:17:45,128 --> 01:17:46,460
What are you talking about?

863
01:17:46,462 --> 01:17:49,163
That's a tough break for a good athlete.

864
01:17:49,398 --> 01:17:51,999
Jack, you know me.

865
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:57,338
Yeah, I know you. I know you.

866
01:17:58,573 --> 01:18:00,675
I know him better.

867
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:07,081
Never was a file, was there, Yuri?

868
01:18:16,091 --> 01:18:18,225
Of course there was no file.

869
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,761
It was simply bait.

870
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:23,597
What I needed was in this vault.

871
01:18:23,599 --> 01:18:25,332
Chagarin was the only one with enough

872
01:18:25,334 --> 01:18:28,369
power and influence to
get me out of jail.

873
01:18:29,004 --> 01:18:31,706
I used him.

874
01:18:33,075 --> 01:18:35,209
I used you.

875
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:39,547
It's about money.

876
01:18:39,549 --> 01:18:41,382
When's it not about money?

877
01:18:41,384 --> 01:18:43,150
You want to arrest me?

878
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:48,956
You're out of your jurisdiction,
Detective McClane, aren't you?

879
01:18:48,958 --> 01:18:52,626
I wouldn't worry too much
about being arrested.

880
01:18:53,428 --> 01:18:55,596
See, my boy

881
01:18:55,964 --> 01:18:58,265
is in the CIA.

882
01:18:58,267 --> 01:19:00,735
No phone call.

883
01:19:01,203 --> 01:19:02,703
Spy shit.

884
01:19:02,705 --> 01:19:07,541
Goddamn Americans. You
think you're so smart.

885
01:19:07,543 --> 01:19:11,879
No, I'm not that smart.
I'm just on vacation.

886
01:19:11,881 --> 01:19:13,914
My boy here,

887
01:19:14,616 --> 01:19:16,917
he gonna put a whooping on you.

888
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:24,625
Move!

889
01:19:29,831 --> 01:19:34,969
You can say goodbye to your
daughter, you dumbwit fuck.

890
01:19:39,741 --> 01:19:42,610
Where's your little Soltschanitsa?

891
01:19:55,524 --> 01:19:57,691
Shit! God damn it!

892
01:20:02,397 --> 01:20:03,697
Shit!

893
01:20:26,589 --> 01:20:28,222
<i>Irina, I'm going to the roof...</i>

894
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:29,490
<i>The roof!</i>

895
01:20:32,394 --> 01:20:34,028
Jack!

896
01:20:51,948 --> 01:20:53,080
<i>Set at 91.</i>

897
01:20:53,082 --> 01:20:54,148
<i>Power plant?</i>

898
01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:55,216
<i>All good to go.</i>

899
01:20:55,218 --> 01:20:56,050
<i>Let's go!</i>

900
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:24,879
Subtle.

901
01:21:24,881 --> 01:21:27,915
What the hell is in those
goddamn grenades?

902
01:21:34,756 --> 01:21:36,090
Go get him!

903
01:21:36,092 --> 01:21:38,926
I'm going to the helicopter!

904
01:22:32,815 --> 01:22:34,615
<i>Vadim, watch the tail.</i>

905
01:22:34,617 --> 01:22:37,284
<i>Copy. You are at 120 meters...</i>

906
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:39,119
<i>...115 meters...</i>

907
01:23:05,347 --> 01:23:07,614
<i>There is small arms fire</i>
<i>coming from the roof.</i>

908
01:23:22,098 --> 01:23:23,030
<i>We have a guest.</i>

909
01:23:23,398 --> 01:23:26,000
<i>Watch the tail for me there.</i>

910
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:34,641
<i>Come on!</i>

911
01:23:34,709 --> 01:23:35,809
<i>Come on, hurry!</i>

912
01:23:35,811 --> 01:23:38,645
<i>Vadim, give me firing control now...</i>

913
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:40,147
<i>Engaging!</i>

914
01:23:46,054 --> 01:23:47,488
Jack!

915
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:51,025
<i>Shoot him!</i>

916
01:23:51,027 --> 01:23:52,493
<i>With pleasure, papa.</i>

917
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:01,335
I'm on fucking vacation!

918
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:05,406
<i>Vadim! He is there! I see him!</i>

919
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,948
The shit we do for our kids.

920
01:24:14,950 --> 01:24:17,351
Yippee ki-yay, motherfucker.

921
01:24:21,524 --> 01:24:22,856
<i>What happened?</i>

922
01:24:31,434 --> 01:24:33,200
<i>CG's shifted...</i>

923
01:24:33,435 --> 01:24:35,469
<i>I've got full forward cyclic.</i>

924
01:25:06,067 --> 01:25:07,968
<i>I can't hold it.</i>

925
01:25:10,572 --> 01:25:11,972
Jesus Christ!

926
01:25:17,345 --> 01:25:18,712
Well done,

927
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:20,914
Mr. Super-spy.

928
01:25:22,517 --> 01:25:27,321
What a shame your father won't
be alive to see you promoted.

929
01:25:28,224 --> 01:25:30,424
Neither will you.

930
01:25:44,906 --> 01:25:47,641
Hey! Jack!

931
01:25:49,511 --> 01:25:51,745
Hang on, John!

932
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:30,617
John!

933
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:37,691
Come on!

934
01:26:45,768 --> 01:26:47,634
<i>We're out of ammunition!</i>

935
01:26:47,902 --> 01:26:49,069
<i>Shit.</i>

936
01:26:49,771 --> 01:26:50,771
<i>Bastards.</i>

937
01:26:50,773 --> 01:26:53,207
<i>What the hell are you doing?</i>

938
01:26:55,543 --> 01:26:56,910
<i>This is for you, papa.</i>

939
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:02,075
John!

940
01:28:04,646 --> 01:28:05,879
John!

941
01:28:07,115 --> 01:28:08,415
John!

942
01:28:15,824 --> 01:28:17,057
John!

943
01:28:21,696 --> 01:28:23,130
Dad!

944
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:26,500
Right here.

945
01:28:53,227 --> 01:28:55,462
Did you just call me Dad?

946
01:28:56,898 --> 01:28:58,265
No.

947
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:01,268
I didn't think so.

948
01:29:02,603 --> 01:29:04,604
You're hearing things.

949
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:08,241
You got swimmer's ear.

950
01:29:16,217 --> 01:29:20,320
We're not gonna grow any third
arms or anything, are we?

951
01:29:20,322 --> 01:29:21,521
No.

952
01:29:21,523 --> 01:29:23,857
You might lose your hair.

953
01:29:24,058 --> 01:29:25,525
Laugh it up, kid.

954
01:29:25,527 --> 01:29:28,595
This is you, five years from now.

955
01:29:28,597 --> 01:29:30,464
It's rainwater. You'll be fine.

956
01:29:30,466 --> 01:29:34,601
Besides, it's hard to kill a McClane.

957
01:29:35,570 --> 01:29:37,270
Now you're a McClane?

958
01:29:37,272 --> 01:29:41,174
Yeah, I'm a McClane. John McClane.

959
01:29:41,176 --> 01:29:43,110
John McClane Junior.

960
01:29:43,444 --> 01:29:46,380
Well, that makes you a "senior."

961
01:29:46,382 --> 01:29:47,914
That's right.

962
01:29:47,916 --> 01:29:49,716
Try not to forget it.

963
01:29:49,718 --> 01:29:51,785
I'm your father.

964
01:29:52,286 --> 01:29:55,989
Have some respect for your father.

965
01:29:56,391 --> 01:29:58,158
Let me ask you something.

966
01:29:59,494 --> 01:30:00,794
Do you go looking for trouble

967
01:30:00,796 --> 01:30:04,598
or does it always just seem to find you?

968
01:30:05,967 --> 01:30:09,603
You know, after all these years,

969
01:30:09,605 --> 01:30:13,273
I still ask myself the same question.
